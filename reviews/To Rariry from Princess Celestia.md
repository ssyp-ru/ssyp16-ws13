Dear Rariry,
===

Let us talk about cli.ts.
------------------------

* I was upset, when I noticed, that cli.ts still knows about
colors, for some shining reason. I hope You will make cli.ts 
forget about it.

* One more time, my beloved Rarity, You either do NOT use more
than two ifs, or I will magic you up really hard. I am
talking about Lines 224-244 by the way.

* And there are a even more ifs in cli.ts


Now, I would like to talk about client.ts
-----------------------------------------

* There is still no that cute code, Twighlight Sparkle was
talking about on Lines 84-105, 137-151.


I am really really sad, because I read format.ts
------------------------------------------------
* Excuse my French, but why this magical shining pile of
sparkles and sunshine is still there?

Your Princess Celestia.
