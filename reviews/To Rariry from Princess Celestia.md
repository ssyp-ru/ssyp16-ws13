Dear Rariry,
===

Let us talk about cli.ts.
------------------------

* I was upset, when I noticed, that cli.ts still knows about
colors, for some shining reason. I hope You will make cli.ts 
forget about it.

> I am open to any suggestions.

* One more time, my beloved Rarity, You either do NOT use more
than two ifs, or I will magic you up really hard. I am
talking about Lines 224-244 by the way.

> If you are unable to read such simple code, well, I think we have a problem. But I am afraid, it's not on my end.

* And there are a even more ifs in cli.ts

> Yep. Open to any suggestions. You know, conditional expressions are quite useful when you write software.


Now, I would like to talk about client.ts
-----------------------------------------

* There is still no that cute code, Twighlight Sparkle was
talking about on Lines 84-105, 137-151.

> Is that about the usage of fsFunctions? If so, no problem. It can be done... But I consider it impractical to do it ASAP.


I am really really sad, because I read format.ts
------------------------------------------------
* Excuse my French, but why this magical shining pile of
sparkles and sunshine is still there?

> When you write something, please, **DO** always have a plan to resolve the problem. I can also write messages like that about something else
without any *exact* suggestions. If you are able to write code better, please, rewrite this code to prove it. By saying "it is garbage" you
can only show off, but not in a good way. I can rewrite this code from scratch, but bearing in mind the deadline (less than in 2 days
from the date of writing this message) it will be... unwise.

Your Princess Celestia.

Always yours, Andrew Boyarshin.
